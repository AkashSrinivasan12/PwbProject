Project ATM management (Pwb)

This project is purely based on HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.
<br/>The login page first requires paswword which is 1234 ,I created this password internally so that it can be only changed inside the code no database is used here to minimise the <br/> workload and to make the client easily understand the basics and to make them concentrate more on javascript.
<br/>The home page contains 6 options which represents the realworld atm in frame.Each button perform its specified task with the help of javascript.
<br/>The Initial money amount is declared at the first line of javascript which is the key variable, to withdraw cash the user can input the value hence the mathematical condition <br/>is met and the result is shown in the same page, similarly everybutton works.
<br/>if any mistake is made during data input amd you want to reload the page the page will automatically redirects you to the login page inorder to reflect the real ATM scenario

<br/>Thankyou!
